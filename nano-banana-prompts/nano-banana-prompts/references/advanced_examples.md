## Character & Scene Creation

### Character Consistency - Initial
```
Create photorealistic character portrait: young woman, late 20s, with distinctive features— 
oval face, high cheekbones, deep brown eyes, straight black shoulder-length hair with blunt 
bangs. Wearing simple white t-shirt. Neutral expression, looking directly at camera against 
plain gray background. Soft, even studio lighting. This will serve as reference for consistent 
character generation. 1:1 format.
```

### Character Consistency - Variation 1
```
Same woman from previous image, now wearing professional blazer and white collared shirt, 
standing confidently in modern glass office overlooking city. Warm afternoon sunlight streams 
through floor-to-ceiling windows. Maintain exact facial features, eye color, and hair style 
from reference image. She's smiling professionally with arms crossed. 16:9 format.
```

### Character Consistency - Variation 2
```
Same woman from reference image, now dressed casually in denim jacket and jeans, laughing 
while walking through autumn park. Golden hour lighting creates warm glow, leaves falling 
around her. Hair windswept but maintain same length and style. Candid, documentary photography 
style with slight motion blur in background. 4:5 portrait format.
```

## Specialized Techniques

### Cinematic Lighting
```
Cinematic portrait of detective in film noir style. Middle-aged man in trench coat and fedora 
illuminated by single shaft of light from window blind, creating dramatic Venetian blind pattern 
across face. Hard shadows and high contrast, rest of dimly-lit office fading to near-black.

of 1940s crime films. 2.39:1 anamorphic widescreen.
```

### Macro Photography
```

reflecting dawn sky in perfect spherical mirrors. Shot with 100mm macro at f/2.8, incredibly 
shallow depth of field renders background into soft bokeh gradient from lavender to pink. 
Backlit by early morning sun, creating luminous halos around each water bead. Scientific beauty 
meeting artistic vision. Square 1:1 format.
```

### HDR Landscape
```

light breaking through, illuminating emerald water below. Steep cliff faces showing rich detail

throughout tonal range while maintaining natural look. Panoramic 21:9 format.
```

## Text Integration

### Event Poster

## Iterative Editing Examples

### Multi-Turn Sequence: Portrait Enhancement

**Turn 1 - Base Generation:**
```
Create professional headshot of woman in her 30s with shoulder-length blonde hair, 
wearing navy blazer against neutral background. Warm, approachable smile. Studio lighting.
```

**Turn 2 - Background Change:**
```
Replace the neutral background with modern office setting—glass walls, city skyline visible, 
contemporary workspace. Keep all subject elements identical.
```

**Turn 3 - Wardrobe Adjustment:**
```
Change her blazer from navy to charcoal gray. Maintain everything else exactly as is.
```

**Turn 4 - Lighting Enhancement:**
```
Add warmer, more golden-hour quality lighting from the office windows, creating soft 
glow and subtle rim lighting on her hair.
```

**Turn 5 - Final Polish:**
```
Slightly increase the professional polish—smoother skin tones, sharper focus on eyes, 
ensure hair is perfectly styled. Maintain natural, not over-processed look.
```

## Style Mixing

### Multiple Style References
```
Portrait combining three distinct influences: composition inspired by Renaissance paintings 
(three-quarter view, dramatic chiaroscuro), color palette from Wes Anderson films (pastel 
pink and teal), and modern fashion photography techniques (sharp focus, high-key lighting). 
Subject is young artist in vintage clothing against geometrically precise pastel pink wall. 
Shot with medium format, creating unique hybrid aesthetic. 4:5 format.
```

## Troubleshooting Complex Requests

### When Details Matter

left hand while right hand and violin body softly blur. Warm stage lighting from above creates 
natural skin tones and wood grain texture. Include rosin dust visible on strings. 3:2 format.
```

### Avoiding Artifacts
```

rendering artifacts. 1:1 format.
