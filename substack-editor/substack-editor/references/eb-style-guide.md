## Humanization Integration

### Key Principles

### Quick Humanization Check

1. Does it sound like something you would actually say to a colleague?
2. Are there specific, concrete examples rather than generic statements?
3. Does the rhythm vary naturally throughout?
4. Can you hear a distinct personality and authentic emotion?
5. Would this pass the "read aloud" test for natural conversation?
